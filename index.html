					<p class="head">LETTER FROM OUR PRESIDENT</p>
					<p>When I first became a CEO, I began reading four to six books per month. I subscribed to books on tapes, went to many seminars and more.</p>
					<p>Although I had run product development groups of 60+ people for years it was overwhelming to suddenly need to learn about marketing, sales, operations, finance, management, leadership and more. My management experience and expertise was mainly in engineering, software and product development.</p>
					<p>Now, as CEO, I was instantly responsible for everything. This is one reason about 85% of new companies will fail today. CEOs are only created by on-the-job training really.</p>
					<p><strong>In my reading I also began to notice that most Authors were specialists in only one thing, few, if any, had the broad experience of being a CEO.</strong> They could never tie everything together in a framework that would enable success. Almost none had even ever run a complex business. And the ones that did were in larger companies, not startups or small business - which are actually much harder to run because you need to figure everything out. These Author’s expertise was an inch wide and a mile deep, when being a CEO and Entrepreneur is about needing to be a mile wide and a few inches deep. Broad, strategic, collaborative to tap into others knowledge and experience as needed.</p>
					<p><strong>What I needed was a broad perspective and scope to learn all these business disciplines at the highest, strategic level</strong> – knowing I would never be an expert in them all. With that experience and my structured, engineering background, I knew I had to create The CEO Boot Camp. It took me over a year, and I created hundreds of slides, best practices and concepts I had been using and teaching clients for years. That program was given on a very limited basis with about 2-3 per year from 2004 to 2010. Then in 2020 I decided to revive the program when I moved to Austin, Texas and saw how badly the entrepreneurs here needed it at the recommendation of a friend. I scheduled an event for April 2020 and had to cancel it due to COVID-19. I then spent 6 months from April to November adding twice the content and filming it all in my green-screen studio. </p>
					<p><strong>I truly believe that it  will allow you to save or make an extra $100,000 within a year. Every graduate has agreed with this statement!</strong> Most should make millions using this information over their careers. Many have done that using just one tool or concept applied to their business. It is possible to make 20X, or even 100X off your investment just in that first year. It is just a matter of how long that ROI will take.</p>
					<p><strong>And I offer a money back guarantee until you have taken one-third of the courses.</strong> So, register today if you want to be in that top few percent of Entrepreneurs that will succeed in creating a new and innovative business that generated wealth and jobs. I hope to meet you there.</p>
